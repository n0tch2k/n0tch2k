		<h3 class="title">Sublime Text 3</h3><span class="date">- 24.05.2015</span>
		<p>A few days ago I started using the editor <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a>
for all my programming. So far I've used it for Bash scripting and HTML/CSS but it was surprisingly easy to
add my own build system to handle LaTeX files. In the past days I could only scratch the surface of this very powerful
editor. With all the available packages, the extendability seems endless.</p>
<p>For colorschemes, you can head over to <a href="http://colorsublime.com/">Colorsublime</a>and grab one of their themes.
Sublime Text's default theme is Monokai which is already pretty awesome though!</p>

		<h3 class="title">Yet another AUR client</h3><span class="date">- 22.05.2015</span>
		<p>I wrote a small script called <a href="https://github.com/n0tch2k/aurinstall">aurinstall</a>
to make it a tad more efficient to install packages from the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a>.
Right now, it just covers the most important basics but it's already enough to make one's life easier.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Working with Gitbook</h3><span class="date">- 22.05.2015</span>
		<p>A while ago, I started moving my <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=157694970">"Ready to GO!?"</a> guide to Gitbook to eventually release
it in PDF, MOBI and epub format. Working with the Gitbook editor is quite nice - even on mobile!</p>
